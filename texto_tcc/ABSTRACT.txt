This paper details the development of a multi-platform application for intelligent shopping list management, using the Flutter framework and the Firebase platform. The project addresses common challenges in organizing purchases, such as collaboration between users, expense tracking, and planning for recurring items. The solution's architecture was based on the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, along with the Repository Pattern for data access abstraction, ensuring a decoupled, testable, and easily maintainable codebase. As main results, the application implements features for sharing lists with permission control, spending analysis with graphical visualization, and a product suggestion system based on the user's purchase history. The work concludes that the use of the Flutter/Firebase ecosystem proved effective for delivering a robust, scalable software solution with a rich and functional user experience.
